# Bug fixes

## September 15, 2026 — overall review repairs

R01–R15 now pass regression verification. Repairs include fill/cancel/exit serialization, durable unknown-exit guards, first-fill deadlines, stream/freshness/expiry gates, canonical Windows ownership, amount-based cash matching, timely WS risk marks, cooldowns, atomic storage, pagination, terminal status normalization and conservative uptime. The maker canary now uses the production safety path. Full details, deliberate fail-closed boundaries and test commands are in the [repair report](docs/REPAIR_REPORT_2026-09-15.md). No live run was authorized or started by these repairs.

## September 15, 2026 — client order ID length

- Symptom: the first commissioning entry received WebSocket status 400 / code -1013 before placement.
- Cause: generated client order IDs were capped at 64 characters, while the live Gemini endpoint enforces 36.
- Correction: IDs are now 34 characters and retain purpose, timestamp, an eight-hex symbol hash, and eight random hex characters.
- Regression: the commissioning-envelope test enforces a maximum length of 36.
- State: corrected before any fill; REST reconciliation proved zero active orders and zero positions.

## September 15, 2026 — late IOC terminal event

- Symptom: after a successful entry and submitted exit, the commissioning consumer stopped on a late lifecycle event belonging to the already-terminal entry.
- Cause: the sequential waiter treated every non-current client ID as unowned, even when the durable mutation owner had created it.
- Correction: late events for any locally owned intent are reduced and ignored by the current-order waiter; genuinely unowned orders still halt the canary.
- Regression: ownership is now an explicit ledger query. REST reconciliation proved the entry and exit both filled for 10 contracts and the account ended with zero positions and zero active orders.
# Production completion fixes — 2026-09-15

- Replaced SQLite floating-point `MAX` risk persistence with Decimal-preserving monotonic calculations in the risk authority before exact-string storage. Added a restart test at sub-cent precision.
- Separated read-only configuration preparation from the exact live acknowledgement so a non-ordering reconcile cannot accidentally become activation.
- Added one-use, expiring, policy-hash-bound activation permits and proved pre-reconciliation, reused, expired and mismatched permits fail closed.
- Added REST/WebSocket account brackets, unowned-order rejection, durable fill IDs, account snapshots, restart-safe inventory deadlines, equity classification, six-hour cap ratchets and local reward-uptime records.
- Added sequential maker-leg acknowledgment, fill-priority cancellation, exact REST-reconciled position exits and emergency drain attempts. A failed drain is terminal and operator-visible rather than reported flat.
- Added atomic status/rank output, redacted rotating logs and native Windows start/STOP scripts with runtime paths constrained below `data`.
